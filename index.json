To counter this problem, various fake news datasets have been constructed. These existing datasets have focused almost exclusively on the factuality aspect of the news. Can we fully understand “fake news” and various events it causes based on these datasets given factuality labels? This is exactly the motivation behind our dataset construction. To promote understanding of fake news, we consider it is necessary to provide not only factual information but also information from various perspectives; the intention of the false news disseminator, the harmfulness of the news to our society, the target of the news, etc. We built a novel annotation scheme with fine-grained labeling to capture the various aspects of fake news, which is built based on the detailed investigations of existing fake news datasets. We then construct the first Japanese fake news dataset according to the annotation scheme. Our dataset can be expected to bring us in-depth understanding of fake news. Dataset Description Our dataset includes 307 news stories, which were verified by Fact Check Initiative Japan between July 2019 and October 2021. We provide our dataset in two folders: One is Label folder, which contains label information by our annotation and fact-checking URLs. Another is Tweet folder, which contains the collected tweet IDs related to each news. Our dataset is published at https://zenodo.org/record/5831617   Label folder This folder contains our annotation labels to each news. It is composed of two files.\n  label.csv This file composes of and ID, article names, URL, and our annotation labels. The file is tsv format, whose column names are below:\n ID Article URL Q1 Q2-1 Q2-2A Q2-2B Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7\n   q3-*.csv We provide the label for Q3 assigned by each annotator. The file is tsv format, whose column names are below:\n ID Q3\n     Tweet folder\nThis folder contains the collected tweet IDs related to each news. In a folder for each news item named news ID, there are two types of posts: one (FS) is tweetIDs related to the original news item and another (FC) is tweets related to the fact-checking article. Additionally, we provide three types of tweet information by separate file:\n Tweet IDs (tweet) User IDs (user) Conversation IDs (conv)   But, each news folder does not always have all these files because of the removal. When we have, in News ID “21”, a list of tweet IDs and user IDs for the original news article (FS) and a list of tweet IDs and user IDs for the fact-checking article related to it (FC), our file structure would be below:\n Tweet/21/FS-21-tweet.txt Tweet/21/FS-21-user.txt Tweet/21/FC-21-tweet.txt Tweet/21/FC-21-user.txt    Paper Read our arXiv paper for more details here\nIf you use this dataset, please cite\n  \nExisting dataset list We examined 51 fake news detection datasets and identified several issues that needed to be resolved for dataset constructuion.
